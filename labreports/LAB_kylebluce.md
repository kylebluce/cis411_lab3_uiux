# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Zip Recruiter | 14 | ZIpRecruiter seemed like a pretty average site to me. It felt similar to Indeed. It did the job well. I liked that it let me upload my resume, to autofill some of my account information. |
| Snagajob | 11 | I am not a big fan of Snagajob. It seemed wordy on some of the steps, and the basic profile creation took longer than I'd like. |

## 2.2 Site 1

![ZipRecruiter1](/labreports/Zip1.png)

This screenshot is the home page of ZipRecruiter. There is no "Create an Account" Button, but the "Get Started" seems to be what they want you to do. They take the location of the user to search jobs in the area. There is a sign-in and post a job button in the top right.

![ZipRecruiter2](/labreports/Zip2.png) 

This is the first step in the account process after clicking Get Started. This would be good for someone who knows exactly what they are looking for.

![ZipRecruiter3](/labreports/Zip3.png) 

This next step is nice because I am currently not looking for work, so it is nice to have that option to click.

![ZipRecruiter4](/labreports/Zip4.png)

This step showed five different jobs that related to my interests, but most of them seemed out of my experience level, so I just skipped through them all.

![ZipRecruiter5](/labreports/Zip5.png) 

This step was really nice because I could upload my resume, although it got some of the information wrong when it translated it to my profile.

![ZipRecruiter6](/labreports/Zip6.png) 

This job search feature is pretty routine. Nothing really stood out to me.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2 | I felt like it was pretty intuitive. I just would've liked to see a "Create Account" button.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 2 | It didn't take long at all to set up. A detailed profile would take a long time.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2 | I felt like the site did an okay job of making the important information clear. I wasn't always sure what was important and what wasn't. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3 | It carried me through the set of steps that were required, so I felt like it made the information clear. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 2 | This site was somewhat wordy in certain spots, but it was good with keeping things concise for the most part.  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 2 | Navigating the site seemed pretty intuitive, or I could at least find my way back. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 1 | I couldn't find much about a screen reader and my browser couldn't read the site for me. |
| **TOTAL** | 14  | Overall, I felt like ZipRecruiter was pretty average for a job searching site. |

## 2.3 Site 2
![SnagAJob1](/labreports/Snag1.png)

This is the home page for SnagAJob. I like how it has the "Create a Profile" as well as the quick job search option, but it is confusing what option I should pick. I clicked create a profile.

![SnagAJob2](/labreports/Snag2.png) 

I was not of fan of their profile creation. They didn't have a spot for me to upload my resume. It just seemed very crowded.

![SnagAJob3](/labreports/Snag3.png)

I like that they have a section to put in availability and job interests. This seems like a good site if you really want to spend a lot of time putting in information.

![SnagAJob4](/labreports/Snag4.png) 

I like their job search feature, but it feels very similar to every other job recruiting website.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2 | I was able to figure it out without any glaring issues. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 1 | In order to create a proper profile, it would've taken me twice the amount of time ZipRecruiter took. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2 | The information was presented well, but the important steps didn't always stand out.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2 | The site did a good job of leading me through a process of what to do next. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 1 | This site was wordy at times. A few of the steps had an entire paragraph explaining what to do. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 2 | I felt like the navigation was similar to any other job search site. It was relatively easy to navigate.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 1 | Again, I couldn't find anything on the site for accessibility or in my browser options. |
| **TOTAL** | 11  | I feel like Snagajob is worse than the average job site. It just doesn't seem as clean and takes too much time. |
